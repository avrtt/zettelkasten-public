Since 2020, I've kept a few different knowledge bases using the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method, as I've found it the best approach to organizing notes for my Arch Linux setup.

Now I keep absolutely all my notes and do task management in text Markdown files, due to the growing concern regarding web services for Russian citizens: our cloud accounts (like Notion) are getting blocked more often, while storing files itself entails confidentiality and data loss risks. So, I went self-hosted, and now I automatically back up my vaults to remote Git repositories.

This is a small public part of my knowledge base template with a Zettelkasten "entry point" located in this special [folder](https://github.com/avrtt/zettelkasten-public/blob/main/vault/ðŸ§ %20zettelkasten), and I keep updating this folder from time to time.
